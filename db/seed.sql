In the process, Stefan Frei registered his league-leading sixth shutout of the season, one more than he had all of last season. The Sounders had several good opportunities to find the go-ahead goal, most notably on a close-range header by Jordan Morris that went just wide, but were forced to settle for just their third regular-season road point against RSL since 2011. </p>\n<p id="fu9klJ">That point also allowed the Sounders to move into first-place in the Western Conference, one ahead of St. Louis City and two ahead of LAFC. It may be a pyrrhic victory, however, as Kelyn Rowe went down with what appeared to be a serious knee injury late in the match.</p>\n<p id="rvOc0z"><strong>MATCH SUMMARY </strong></p>\n<p id="JZ3xEJ">Seattle Sounders FC 0 – Real Salt Lake 0</p>\n<p id="Oa8uuT">Saturday, April 29, 2023 </p>\n<p id="Oq7P3T"><strong>Venue: </strong>America First Field</p>\n<p id="4bwIUU"><strong>Referee: </strong>Nima Saghafi</p>\n<p id="1N5GPk"><strong>Assistants:</strong> Jeffrey Greeson, Brian Dunn</p>\n<p id="DNlhyK"><strong>Fourth Official:</strong> Chris Elliott</p>\n<p id="L6epno"><strong>VAR:</strong> Kevin Stott</p>\n<p id="FQCQAR"><strong>Attendance:</strong> 20,714</p>\n<p id="PSav65"><strong>Weather: </strong>78 degrees and clear<strong> </strong></p>\n<p id="nQFOzQ"><strong>SCORING SUMMARY </strong></p>\n<p id="xKO9OB">None </p>\n<p id="JtL00O"><strong>MISCONDUCT SUMMARY </strong></p>\n<p id="vmmFxS"><strong>SEA – </strong>João Paulo (caution) 8’</p>\n<p id="81qJUh"><strong>RSL –</strong> Jefferson Savarino (caution) 9’</p>\n<p id="TBJqaO"><strong>RSL –</strong> Bryan Oviedo (caution) 36’</p>\n<p id="z3ZHAv"><strong>RSL –</strong> Justen Glad (caution) 53’</p>\n<p id="RihvGt"><strong>RSL –</strong> Pablo Ruiz (caution) 62’</p>\n<p id="PW1gs2"><strong>RSL –</strong> Braian Ojeda (caution) 69’</p>\n<p id="ID2wrf"><strong>SEA –</strong> Alex Roldan (caution) 72’</p>\n<p id="NhL5c4"><strong>RSL –</strong> Pablo Ruiz (caution, ejection) 90’+4’</p>\n<p id="hhVcG3"><strong>SEA –</strong> Albert Rusnák (caution) 90’+4’ </p>\n<p id="QuZ9fr"><strong>LINEUPS &amp; STATS</strong></p>\n<p id="HnLeQA"><strong>Seattle Sounders FC –</strong> Stefan Frei; Alex Roldan, Yeimar, Jackson Ragen, Kelyn Rowe (Reed Baker-Whiting 90’+1); João Paulo (Xavier Arreaga 90’+1’), Albert Rusnák, Jordan Morris, Nico Lodeiro, Léo Chú (Dylan Teves 71’); Héber (Fredy Montero 81’) </p>\n<p id="sRpsR6"><strong>Substitutes not used:</strong> Stefan Cleveland, Josh Atencio, Obed Vargas, Sota Kitahara, Ethan Dobbelaere </p>\n<p id="tb0CZv"><strong>Total shots:</strong> 12</p>\n<p id="RBUylJ"><strong>Shots on goal:</strong> 1</p>\n<p id="BvEwxA"><strong>Fouls:</strong> 7</p>\n<p id="32hqjC"><strong>Offside:</strong> 2</p>\n<p id="ezKWnQ"><strong>Corner-Kicks:</strong> 2</p>\n<p id="KXCpoy"><strong>Saves:</strong> 3<strong> </strong></p>\n<p id="8qMV04"><strong>Real Salt Lake – </strong>Zac MacMath; Bryan Oviedo, Brayan Vera, Justen Glad, Marcelo Silva; Pablo Ruiz, Jefferson Savarino, Carlos Gomez (Emeka Eneli 90’+4’), Scott Caldwell (Braian Ojeda 56’); Rubio Rubin (Damir Kreilach 81’), Danny Musovski (Bertin Jacquesson 56’)</p>\n<p id="2B5vQc"><strong>Substitutes not used:</strong> Gavin Beavers, Maikel Chang, Paul Ilijah, Diego Luna, Moses Nyeman<strong> </strong></p>\n<p id="kJ7SPX"><strong>Total shots:</strong> 15</p>\n<p id="8hh0Go"><strong>Shots on goal:</strong> 3</p>\n<p id="8dM6us"><strong>Fouls:</strong> 13</p>\n<p id="zgt3tG"><strong>Offside:</strong> 2</p>\n<p id="OESbpK"><strong>Corner-kicks:</strong> 7</p>\n<p id="YDVKbU"><strong>Saves:</strong> 1 </p>\n  <figure class="e-image">\n        <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GE-s3tAZb-e75c6-3f3n2c2mn1w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24622917/Screenshot_2023_04_30_at_7.41.36_AM.png">\n      <cite><a class="ql-link" href="https://www.fotmob.com/match/4084759/matchfacts/seattle-sounders-fc-vs-real-salt-lake" target="_blank">FotMob.com</a></cite>\n  </figure>\n<h1 id="eX29vL">Post-match quotes</h1>\n<div id="nzZ4CS"><div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uQBb9CO1lJ4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></div></div>\n<div id="Cm2qW4"><div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aJCasa_X6Eo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></div></div>	\N	2023-04-30 07:49:41-07	2023-04-30 07:49:41-07	690a8358b2a6fa63

After a lot of poor finishing and some less-than-stellar passing, a lot of physical play and a well-deserved second-yellow red card to Pablo Ruiz in stoppage time the game ended 0-0.</p>\n<p id="LLp38l">Both sides had stretches of possession and dangerous chances throughout the first half. RSL’s best moments seemed to come from transition moments as they attempted to punish Seattle for giveaways, but time after time Stefan Frei was there to keep them off the scoreboard. Seattle got into plenty of dangerous spots, but Zac MacMath wasn’t required to intervene much as the Sounders got in their own way or let themselves down with a final pass or touch more often than not. At the halftime whistle the game was still as it had started: scoreless.</p>\n<p id="69XfD2">There were plenty of moments when a goal was there for the taking, through craft or guile, but neither side seemed to have what they needed. As the game wore on the altitude seemed to clearly be taking its toll on Seattle, and the repeated kicks and clashes that they suffered from RSL took their own toll as well. Nine yellow cards were shown in total, with six of them going to Salt Lake including Pablo Ruiz receiving two of them after a stamp on Nico Lodeiro as the game ticked into stoppage time.</p>\n<p id="DdfiZJ">It's a frustrating attacking performance, but ultimately it's a shutout and a point on the road. Whatever good feeling may have come from the result was likely wiped out by Kelyn Rowe having to be helped off of the field late on with an apparent knee injury.</p>\n<h1 id="6Nz2zw">Key moments</h1>\n<p id="nHgAnQ"><strong>9’ — </strong>A fortunate bounce of the ball puts Léo Chú goal side of his defender and he plays a ball across the box that nearly finds Héber on the doorstep.</p>\n<p id="aJkjPp"><strong>11’ — </strong>Alex Roldan plays Jordan Morris through after picking a pass off. Morris hits a dangerous cross that nearly finds the net off of a touch from a defender.</p>\n<p id="zjVx2J"><strong>18’ — </strong>The first real look for RSL comes from a dangerous cross off of the wing and a header around the 6-yard box for Rubio Rubin, but the shot goes just wide of the far post.</p>\n<p id="rXgsfh"><strong>21’ — </strong>Chú nutmegs a defender and dribbles into the box to lay the ball off to Héber, whose first-time effort is saved well by Zac MacMath at the near post.</p>\n<p id="c02bkc"><strong>29’ — </strong>João Paulo plays a little slip pass at the edge of the RSL box with Héber and Morris both running onto it. Héber takes the shot but pulls it wide.</p>\n<p id="uDo8VN"><strong>30’ — </strong>Stefan Frei makes an excellent leaping, one-handed save to stop a twisting shot from distance, then is able to pop the ball over the bar and deny any chance of a rebound.</p>\n<p id="AHBG3L"><strong>45’ — </strong>RSL play quickly through Seattle following a giveaway from Morris on the sideline and Rubin gets another good look that’s just kept out by a diving save from Frei.</p>\n<p id="AhkOEx"><strong>47’ — </strong>Alex Roldan sends in a tantalizing cross from the right that just misses connecting with Morris’s head right in front of goal.</p>\n<p id="DBKITS"><strong>51’ — </strong>Another in a long line of very close chances for Seattle as Chú slips a ball through for Morris, who just gets there ahead of MacMath and rounds him but can’t get a good look.</p>\n<p id="lpMmEz"><strong>78’ — </strong>A great touch from Héber gets him through the defense, and another clever touch sets Morris up with a great chance but the shot goes high.</p>\n<h1 id="ioKDNY">Quick thought</h1>\n<p id="vMRV7W"><strong>Ode to Kelyn Rowe: </strong>Kelyn Rowe came to Seattle having already accomplished more than many players ever do. He’d constructed a meaningful and impressive career in professional soccer, initially making his way as that most elusive of American players: a god’s honest no. 10. He played himself into the <a href="https://www.starsandstripesfc.com/">USMNT</a> conversation, but some injury trouble and the ever-changing makeup of the league forced him to adjust as he made his way back across the country from his time with the New England Revolution, stopping at Sporting Kansas City and Real Salt Lake before finally arriving home in Seattle. He joined his hometown club a journeyman and a veteran, willing to play on a team-friendly deal in whatever role was required of him. In that manner he’s consistently been available, he’s been a vocal leader and a guiding presence for younger guys, and he’s put in solid, reliable performances. There’s not much more you can ask for from a veteran depth piece. He’s been a legitimate backup option at a number of spots, including left back. We won’t know the severity of his injury for a little while, but it’s undeniably a blow. Hopefully the people around him are able to lift him up and help him through it. Get well soon.</p>\n<p id="HKjLe5"><strong>Feeling Cristian Roldan’s absence: </strong>I don’t know that having Cristian Roldan available would have changed the result of this game, but it probably would have made the task of keeping the Sounders attack in check a bit more complicated. In Cristian Roldan’t absence Brian Schmetzer has rolled out Jordan Morris on the right side of the attack with Léo Chú keeping his spot on the left. It’s not a bad option, and it gets a lot of quality attacking talent on the field, but there’s a reason Morris has moved primarily over to the left for a while now. Deployed on the right, Morris has a tendency to drift centrally which does help to occupy the centerbacks, but it also puts a lot of weight on Alex Roldan’s shoulders to maintain and provide width to the attack and prevent opponents from attacking down that side. With Cristian Roldan in that spot he and his brother more evenly split those duties as they overload and outwit whoever has the misfortune of lining up opposite them. Add the outrageous chemistry and understanding between them to Cristian’s attacking abilities in their own right and the Sounders just aren’t the same without him on the field. Once again, get well soon, we all hope for a complete recovery.</p>\n<p id="BJa2of"><strong>Championships are built on defense: </strong>For a brief moment, the Sounders are on top of the West with 20 points through 10 games. They’ve only allowed seven goals through those 10 games, and four of those came in that nightmarish Portland Timbers game. This was the sixth clean sheet of the season for Seattle, and the first to come away from Lumen Field. It would have been great to get the win, and that’s surely something the team will talk about in training this week, but the result is an objectively good one. Trips to face RSL have long been cursed ones, and it’s absolutely necessary to come away with a result of some kind when the team travels and while RSL’s place in the table doesn’t strike fear in the heart they had scored three goals in each of their last two home games. This Sounders team has everything they need to add more silverware to the trophy case, and this game is another step towards doing just that.</p>\n<h1 id="rqFQI5">Did you see that?!?</h1>\n<p id="NbXpeQ">Stefan Frei was clutch, as usual. </p>\n<div id="rDzYX2">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Clutch save from <a href="https://twitter.com/Stefan24Frei?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Stefan24Frei</a> to keep it scoreless!  <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RSLvSEA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RSLvSEA</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Sounders?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Sounders</a> <a href="https://t.co/r7fXuEghcl">pic.twitter.com/r7fXuEghcl</a></p>— Seattle Sounders FC (@SoundersFC) <a href="https://twitter.com/SoundersFC/status/1652500262530187269?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2023</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>\n</div>\n<h1 id="1gLRah">He said what?!?</h1>\n<div id="csgUAF">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Coach Brian Schmetzer notes that it’s a knee injury for Rowe and probably serious.

The Sounders have an all-time record of 1-11-3 there in the regular season, which actually understates how bad they’ve been in recent years.</p>\n<p id="QR8lB9">Since winning there on May 28, 2011, the Sounders are 0-10-2 in the regular season at <a href="https://www.rslsoapbox.com">Real Salt Lake</a>’s home stadium. During Brian Schmetzer’s tenure, the Sounders have an 0-5-1 record there, with the only points coming in a 2-2 tie on Sept. 2, 2020. The only other stadium in which they’ve even lost half of their games is Providence Park, and that’s only barely (11 of 21 visits). </p>\n<p id="8FfZnu">What’s so strange about the Sounders’ struggles in Sandy is that RSL has been pretty bad for a lot of those years, and the Sounders have mostly been pretty good. In fact, the Sounders have a 7-2-0 record against RSL at home during Schmetzer’s time in charge. But their trips to Utah almost always seem to come at a time of fixture congestion or an injury crisis.</p>\n<p id="2lfIMj">This meeting comes amidst both, at least in a sense. The Sounders will be missing three likely starters and are coming off a midweek game in the <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/us-open-golf">U.S. Open</a> Cup, albeit one in which they only used two likely starters, neither of whom played more than 45 minutes.</p>\n<h1 id="ciOwU8">Notes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li id="eBKmXA">The Sounders have won 2 of 4 road games this year, just one fewer win than they had all of 2022.</li>\n<li id="W5ZLw5">RSL have won 3 of 4 after winning just 1 of 5 to start the season. </li>\n<li id="VODuVL">Jefferson Savarino had a goal and an assist in his last game, the sixth time he’s done that since rejoining RSL last May.

Paramount+. Watch with us.</p> <p id="nBaevC">Riding a three-game winning streak in regular-season play, <a href="https://www.sounderatheart.com">OL Reign</a> is on the road this Saturday to take on Racing Louisville FC. The match kicks off at 4:30 PM PT at Lynn Family Stadium and will stream on Paramount+ (U.S.), TSN+ (Canada), and <a href="http://NWSLSoccer.com">NWSLSoccer.com</a> (International).</p>\n<p id="3ZFu15">Saturday’s match starts another three-game week for the Reign, who host Angel City on Wednesday for a Challenge Cup match before welcoming the <a href="https://www.dynamotheory.com/">Houston Dash</a> for a regular season game on Saturday evening.</p>\n<p id="GZdOWL">Racing Louisville is coming off a two-game road trip where they drew 2-2 with Angel City FC before losing 2-0 to the Portland Thorns. OL Reign won all three matches in a three-game week, including their first Challenge Cup game of the year.</p>\n<p id="3PUZdZ">The game marks an important milestone for the league, as it will be the 1,000th NWSL regular-season match. OL Reign and Racing Louisville held a joint press conference with captains Lauren Barnes and Jaelin Howell to commemorate the moment. Both reflected on the progress that’s been made and the increase in women’s soccer investment over the last few years.</p>\n<p id="UTZHzD">“There’s been a lot of change, especially with the last three years. We started at Starfire, and then now we’re in Lumen, it just goes to show you where the league is going, and where the investments are going, which I think is really important to highlight,” Barnes said. </p>\n<p id="XMM4yv">The Reign captain noted that this investment has also produced a more competitive league, with young players making instant impacts for their clubs.</p>\n<p id="zInApg">“For me, with this being my 11th [season], I think it’s the best competition I’ve seen from top to bottom, which is really fun for me. I think the development and investment in the youth has been incredible to watch. When I was here in 2013, the pool was very limited, diluted as well, and we continue to expand.” </p>\n<p id="Ax3Rzn">Barnes isn’t wrong about the tight competition, and Racing Louisville (0-1-3) — while still searching for their first win of the season — is going to be a tough opponent for the Reign on Saturday. In fact, the Reign haven’t defeated Louisville on the road in the last two regular seasons — drawing three of the last four matches against the 2021 expansion team.</p>\n<aside id="zt3iyE"><div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Five things to know about Racing Louisville ","url":"https://www.sounderatheart.com/seattle-reign/2023/4/27/23701389/five-things-to-know-racing-louisville-ol-reign"}]}'></div></aside><p id="zSt6nT"><a href="https://www.sounderatheart.com/seattle-reign/2023/4/27/23701389/five-things-to-know-racing-louisville-ol-reign">What makes Racing Louisville so dangerous</a>? A rotated Reign squad in the Portland preseason tournament fell 2-0 to Louisville because they couldn’t handle the team’s constant pressure and press. Savannah DeMelo also has lethal service on set pieces, in addition to being disruptive with her ability to carry the ball forward in the attack, and both Howell and Abby Erceg are strong in the air.</p>\n<p id="jwIc9L">Louisville’s new additions — Erceg, Carson Pickett, and Elli Pikkujämsä on the backline, Ary Borges in the midfield, and Uchenna Kanu on the frontline — have given Racing more stability on the defensive side while also giving them more creativity and bite in the attack. While they looked vulnerable in transition in 2022, Racing is more settled this season. Alongside these newcomers, Katie Lund returns as Louisville’s goalkeeper. She was one of the best shot-stoppers last year and leads the league in saves so far in 2023.</p>\n<p id="transcript-list-item-112">“It’s an opponent that we know is also a threat on set pieces,” OL Reign head coach Laura Harvey said about Louisville in a pre-match press conference. “We know obviously from playing them in preseason that they also like to press, so we’ve got to be prepared to be able to counteract that a little bit.” </p>\n<p id="jzVP6F">How can OL Reign beat the press? They have to be clean in possession while building out of the back — and look for the space that’s available behind the pressure.</p>\n<p id="Kxu4c1">Last weekend, the Reign figured out how to make the most of their touches in the final third, and they should get plenty of chances in this area of the field again on Saturday. After four matches, Louisville has allowed the most passes into their final third and penalty box out of any team in the league. It will be up to OL Reign to once again have a great final ball or shot if they get those chances. </p>\n<p id="w1mZiU">Unfortunately, the Reign will once again be without Quinn and Rose Lavelle, whose knee injury that was described as a minor knock by U.S. Soccer has now kept her out of four matches. Olivia Van der Jagt is out once again with an excused absence, which is typically for personal reasons. Their teammates have stepped up while they’ve been out and will look to do the same again this weekend. </p>\n<p id="uUy60a">If OL Reign gets its first regular season win in Louisville, it will be the club’s 100th win. The Reign would join Portland as the only team so far to reach this milestone.</p>\n<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ePrjDg">\n<h1 id="2ryCRQ">Injury / Availability Report</h1>\n<p id="NO3HGx"><strong>OL Reign</strong></p>\n<p id="lLh5jN">OUT: Angelina (SEI – knee), Rose Lavelle (leg), Phoebe McClernon (back), Veronica Latsko (excused absence), Quinn (leg), Olivia Van der Jagt (excused absence)</p>\n<p id="ZTTSdg"><strong>Racing Louisville</strong></p>\n<p id="g22rWd">OUT: Jordyn Bloomer (back), Emina Ekic (ankle), Thembi Kgatlana (ankle), Jess McDonald (excused absence), Nadia Nadim (knee), Elli Pikkujämsä (thigh)</p>\n<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="xpkaq1">\n<h1 id="j2mLjj">Referees</h1>\n<div id="hQfUTo">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="fr" dir="ltr">⚽// <a href="https://twitter.com/RacingLouFC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RacingLouFC</a> vs <a href="https://twitter.com/OLReign?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@OLReign</a> (7:30PM ET)<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PRO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PRO</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NWSL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NWSL</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RacingLou?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RacingLou</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ReignSupreme?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ReignSupreme</a> <a href="https://t.co/CL1fP3ZA56">pic.twitter.com/CL1fP3ZA56</a></p>— PRO (@PROreferees) <a href="https://twitter.com/PROreferees/status/1652304248632143874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2023</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>\n</div>\n<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ioYmtM">\n<h1 id="nKEOty">Lineups</h1>\n<div id="RGnii2">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Your Starting XI   Racing Louisville FC<br><br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/paramountplus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@paramountplus</a> | TSN+<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ReignSupreme?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ReignSupreme</a> <a href="https://t.co/eu8ZZYh8G8">pic.twitter.com/eu8ZZYh8G8</a></p>— OL Reign (@OLReign) <a href="https://twitter.com/OLReign/status/1652442179258978307?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2023</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>\n</div>\n<div id="vUeeu5">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ready for it.  <a href="https://twitter.com/julia_lest?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@julia_lest</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/paigeqmonaghan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@paigeqmonaghan</a> are poised to make their first starts of the season.

You know that they have not won there since 2012 and not in the regular season since 2011. You’re probably aware of who <a href="https://www.rslsoapbox.com">Real Salt Lake</a> is — as the only team the Sounders have faced more than RSL is the Galaxy.</p>\n<p id="4ha0co">You may not know that Salt Lake is bad this year — legitimately. Yes, they sit above the soft orange line that is the playoff demarcation this season, but that’s because 64% of teams make the playoffs.</p>\n<p id="Yz1rrl">Pablo Mastroeni’s squad is just 2-2-0, -1 at home this year. Brian Schmetzer is 2-2-0, +1 on the road. It’s a great day to break tradition and grab a road win in Utah. It should be in the low 70s with a beautiful sunset and the Sounders still have the Golden Boot leader, the clean sheet leader, two players in the top 3 for assists, two players in the top ten for interceptions and more rest for their starters after the midweek Open Cup extra time wins for both teams.</p>\n<p id="LMSOqE">For <a href="https://www.wasatch.soccer/">Wasatch Soccer Sentinel</a>, Matt answers Three Questions.</p>\n<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fMaWbY">\n<p id="yDSxbI"><strong>SaH</strong>: How will the Open Cup win impact the weekend’s match?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id="Oz8hAZ"><strong>WSS</strong>: Only a handful of players played the full 120 minutes in that one, but among them were Braian Ojeda and Damir Kreilach, two players who could make a starting argument in normal conditions. Kreilach has already been listed as “probable” for the match, so I simply wouldn’t expect him to play — and I suppose at this point, I’m starting to wonder what his role with the team is and what it should be. Ojeda is a different story. He’s a capable midfielder whose primary quality appears to be his relentlessness, and 120 minutes means he’s not likely to appear in this one. He’s young enough that he could, but injuries to other players in the midfield could see him more needed than he is available. That’s a suboptimal position to be in as a team, and that’s probably the biggest impact.</p>\n<p id="grGHj0">Otherwise, I think we’re all just holding our breath that Justen Glad coming off in the 60th minute was not injury related and just a planned substitution. Glad didn’t make the injury report, but you never really know.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p id="lHn2iB"><strong>SaH</strong>: Real Salt Lake is mediocre at home, which is much better than they are on the road. The problems seem to be defensive. Is this a function of tactics or personnel?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id="XJtmga"><strong>WSS</strong>: This is a classic situation of a little from column A, a little from column B. I’d agree that the problems manifest most clearly in the team’s defending, but I think we also see them appear when the team struggles to score. This is a midfield that is simply being asked to do too much in both phases of play, and with only two players in central midfield slots, that sort of load is just not conducive to effective play. Now, does that mean they won’t figure it out for some matches? Absolutely not. We’ve seen this team put it together quite nicely twice, once against San Jose and once against Charlotte. But I lean towards skepticism that it’s reproducible, which is a painful position as a supporter — seeing greatness and thinking it’s going to just sort of randomly appear when you roll a critical success? I’d much rather see success week-in, week-out, even if it means hitting that top mark is a little less exciting.</p>\n<p id="gBfvFu">I’ve somehow said all that without answering the question at hand: Is it tactics or personnel? I think it’s clear it’s both. We talked about some of that on Off the Crossbar this week, and I stand by this idea: RSL’s problem isn’t personnel depth, it’s that players 3 to 11 on the roster are about as good as players 12 to 18. The depth the team possesses is competitive for first-team minutes, and while that’s good in some cases, it’s not something you want across the board. A more advantageous position would be to have clearly better players on the roster than others and to be able to utilize those better players more regularly. Instead, RSL has four midfielders (Braian Ojeda, Pablo Ruiz, Jasper Löffelsend and Scott Caldwell) who are roughly at the same level with no clear starters.</p>\n<p id="RNW2zX">That said, I also can’t look beyond the tactics of it all. When the same gaps in the midfield appear week-in, week-out, with the only variance being how badly RSL is punished for those gaps, then I suspect there are tactical things afoot. This is all complicated by a coach who actively and loudly proclaims that tactics are trivial compared to the proper functioning of the human being, or that “it’s not about tactics.” RSL coach Pablo Mastroeni veers into life coach territory when discussing this team, and it’s hard to come to grips with how that impacts the entirety of play.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p id="Wl5yzt"><strong>SaH</strong>: I had Damir Kreilach on my fantasy team because I kept thinking he would finally play. I cut him. Does this mean he’s going to start again and do well?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id="N8GRye"><strong>WSS</strong>: Kreilach has been a player for Real Salt Lake whose name could have been written in the history books. He’s scored the biggest goals of the post-Kreis era, and he’s lifted this team single-handedly on occasion. However, Kreilach in 2023 is but a shadow of his former self. A back injury sustained in 2022 — one which required surgery to repair — has left him a shadow of his former self. He doesn’t look like the player he once was. His instincts, of course, are still there — look no further than his 120-minute performance in the U.S. Open Cup, where he scored twice in an important advancement win against Las Vegas Lights. Perhaps it’s a sign there’s life in Kreilach’s legs yet. Or perhaps it’s a player who can still score goals on occasion doing just that. Whatever the case, Kreilach represents a bit of tragedy in the story of Real Salt Lake. A once-great player, RSL’s captain, now seeing the field less than he’s on the bench or receiving medical treatment.</p>\n<p id="Cdbk9Y">Maybe I’m wrong on all this, and Kreilach will go on a tear. If you take him off your team now, it sure feels bad when he does. (I think, at least. I’ve honestly not played enough fantasy to really advise you on this. I’m really good at putting together a team at the start of the season then ignoring them, so take my advice with a grain of salt.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="RudOHi">\n<p id="nH3yL1">They won’t have a reverse today, but they will have <a href="https://www.wasatch.soccer/post/2023-04-29/134/what-we're-watching-in-real-salt-lake-vs-seattle-sounders">an excellent preview</a>.</p>	\N	2023-04-29 10:06:01-07	2023-04-29 10:06:01-07	6bd143e5432a8133

But the Sounders will be expecting a very different kind of game in Utah, where they have not won in MLS play since <a href="https://youtu.be/_aoQjpdryBQ?t=288">Mario Martínez’s moment of playoff magic over 10 years ago</a>. While Seattle settled themselves with a tenacious home victory against Minnesota, Salt Lake have stabilized their woeful start with three wins in four matches across MLS and Open Cup play. Let’s look at how the Sounders cracked the code against the Loons, and how they might end the run of rough results in Sandy, Utah.</p>\n<h1 id="dnXl2N">What’s New With RSL?</h1>\n<p id="fEY7T0">Plenty has changed since the Sounders dominated RSL in early March. Newcomer Andrés Gómez has won a starting spot on the wing and contributed a goal and four assists in those matches. While veteran attacker Justin Meram was traded away this week, the remaining RSL attackers have shown signs of life through the play of Gómez and Jefferson Savarino. Still, Salt Lake’s defense is a major concern, as the team has conceded the most goals per match and second most expected goals behind CF Montréal.</p>\n<p id="LfqYag">On the Sounders’ side, the injury bug has bitten key players. Raúl Ruidíaz, Cristian Roldan, and Nouhou are all out for Saturday’s match. While a Seattle team of mostly reserve players fought to an epic, 5-4 victory in U.S. Open Cup play on Wednesday, Real Salt Lake started a more MLS-heavy lineup in a 3-1 victory over Las Vegas Lights FC that required extra time. Notable players such as Pablo Ruiz, Justen Glad, and Damir Kreilach started, with the latter playing a full 120 minutes. </p>\n<h1 id="6zj7oI">Sussing Out Seattle</h1>\n<p id="k7KBd4">Against the Loons last Saturday, the Sounders controlled the game throughout but struggled to find the final pass. Cristian Roldan’s absence was notable yet again, as the team’s attacking combinations in the final third were lacking. While Albert Rusnák played nominally as a winger, the Sounders midfielder tried to find a more comfortable home in the right half-space supporting an overlapping Alex Roldan on the touchline:</p>\n  <figure class="e-image">\n        <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uogQ-OjeexddZ8dZ6wmsyX71AW0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24618019/RusnakHalfSpace1.gif">\n      <figcaption>The Sounders’ ideal attacking shape in the first half, with Rusnák in the half space feeding passes to an overlapping Alex Roldan.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id="NRNYlm">Though the team was able to work the ball up field with this attacking shape, things broke down around the box. Héber found it difficult to affect this match with his back to goal. Minnesota’s centerbacks stayed glued to his back and forced errant touches while Seattle’s attackers provided fewer options. While Rusnák has incredible instincts in the center of the pitch, there were notable moments when a first-choice wide attacker like Roldan or Morris may have recognized a run better run.</p>\n  <figure class="e-image">\n        <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u4aO2SZrvCjRzKPEsL-yqmscfO0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24618031/RusnakRun2.gif">\n      <figcaption>The Sounders front four struggled to connect in the first half.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id="uM3ysD">As the half progressed, Rusnák spent more time with João Paulo in the center, and gave us some dazzling runs like this one:</p>\n  <figure class="e-image">\n        <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WDblpWMgwAFWYcccrw55AgJx59k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24618037/RusnakDribble1.gif">\n      <figcaption>Rusnák parts the seas centrally, then finds Léo Chú in space.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id="vRR1VP">Not to throw any shade at Obed Vargas, who I thought had a good shift against Minnesota and a much-improved performance over the match in Portland, but Rusnák brings a unique level of skill to Seattle’s possession in the middle. Once Jordan Morris subbed on in the second half, the Sounders were able to keep Minnesota pinned in their own end. In fact, it was another central run from Rusnák that led to two blocked shots and a throw-in deep in Minnesota’s half — the throw-in that Rusnák buried off a layoff from Fredy Montero. </p>\n<h1 id="NdttjJ">Real Talk</h1>\n<p id="jDJeP5">The RSL attack has finally come to life, with seven goals in their last three matches. With Damir Kreilach limited due to injury, Jefferson Savarino has taken a larger creative role in the middle of the pitch, drifting inside from the left wing to facilitate possession. In the following clip, defensive midfielder Pablo Ruiz has dropped back in front of his centerbacks to receive the ball and start RSL’s possession. Savarino has moved inside to occupy a gaping space between San Jose’s lines in their 4-3-3 shape:</p>\n  <figure class="e-image">\n        <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MaAj1TWqetlOhvbAjLfQNPDcvnE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24617819/SavarinoReceive2.gif">\n      <figcaption>Jefferson Savarino finds space centrally between San Jose’s lines and a quick turn leads to an opportunity.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id="jKjfQH">Ruiz is able to avoid the pressure of San Jose’s forward line. The Quakes’ midfield three is too worried about RSL’s fullback out wide and too slow to react to cut off the passing lane to Savarino. RSL’s speedy forward Anderson Julio helps open the gap for Savarino by occupying San Jose’s centerbacks. This sequence shows how quickly Savarino can receive the ball on the turn and give chances to RSL’s fast forwards.</p>\n<p id="MxsotX">On the other wing, Andrés Gómez has found a rhythm:</p>\n  <figure class="e-image">\n        <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tiDNBEcsgCW9VjvieKdd74qPdXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24617806/GomezRun1.gif">\n      <figcaption>Andrés Gómez shows his skill with a clever turn and cross.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id="3tOuZ0">The U22 Initiative signing scored his first goal for the club last weekend, and appears to be a legitimate threat on the right side to complement Savarino.</p>\n<h1 id="7ymHBt">Keys to Victory Against RSL</h1>\n<h2 id="RLJJFC">Attack the fullbacks</h2>\n<p id="sNFNXd">RSL’s fullbacks have been a defensive liability, and injuries are exacerbating the problem. Homegrown Bode Hidalgo, starting with Andrew Brody out injured, has good physical tools but is raw defensively. In this sequence, Hidalgo gets his body positioning all wrong, and a run across his face by Cade Cowell earns a wide-open chance. </p>\n  <figure class="e-image">\n        <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SNj2B7ivfBh2be-XhqhvS4SqJOA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24617808/HidalgoError1.gif">\n      <figcaption>RSL fullback Bode Hidalgo gets turned around by Cade Cowell’s run, but the attacker cannot capitalize.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id="XBWaYk"><a href="https://twitter.com/lucaswmuller/status/1651961699635953664?s=20">Both Brody and fullback Brayan Vera are questionable for Saturday</a> with injuries. Léo Chú and Jordan Morris need to force their replacements into difficult situations out wide.</p>\n<h2 id="atUh2n">More Tiki Taka</h2>\n<p id="6jYVdb">The interplay between the Roldan brothers, Lodeiro, and Jordan Morris was a sight to see in March. This match is an opportunity for Héber to rebound against a team the Sounders shredded with quick passing. RSL’s defense are still struggling with forwards who can drop off the line, as Jeremy Ebobisse did last weekend:</p>\n  <figure class="e-image">\n        <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QKzdLzwUZTX7s5bTpM_S74yCcUU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24617488/EbobisseBackToGoal1small2.gif">\n      <figcaption>Jeremy Ebobisse tracks back to join the build-up, then explodes past RSL’s defense.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<h2 id="okBZbw">Defense Starts Up Top</h2>\n<p id="ZDaHTE">Brian Schmetzer consistently preaches that great defensive performances start with Seattle’s attacking players. The hard work to track back and press keeps the back line from facing no-win situations. With both defensive stalwarts Cristian Roldan and Nouhou absent, and facing the likes of Savarino and Gómez on the counter, Seattle will need a team effort to prevent dangerous transition opportunities.</p>\n<p id="FOfcET">Playing away in Sandy has been a slog for a decade. Injuries notwithstanding, Seattle will feature a rested team, ready to play at altitude. For a team with Supporters’ Shield ambitions, it is high time for a win at RSL.</p>\n<p id="QUWi7D">Note: All statistics via <a href="https://fbref.com/en/comps/22/Major-League-Soccer-Stats">FBref.com</a></p>\n<p id="diIIox"></p>\n<p id="kf8CGZ"></p>	\N	2023-04-28 15:00:00-07	2023-04-28 15:00:00-07	22872923c81e0b7a

But in the weeks leading up to the match, the Sounders lost Cristian Roldan, Nouhou and Raúl Ruidíaz for various reasons. Josh Atencio was also still working himself back into full fitness.</p>\n<p id="Rjy5yT">Using a bunch of regular starters wasn’t really an option without also sacrificing the Sounders’ ability to field a full lineup in their upcoming league game.</p>\n<p id="nV5Vdc">Instead, Schmetzer opted for a starting lineup that could only charitably even be called “heavily rotated.” The entire starting lineup had a total of eight 2023 regular-season starts among them, and five of those belonged to Léo Chú. Eight players had zero regular-season starts and just 74 minutes combined, with four of them getting their first first-team minutes of the season. </p>\n<p id="lVWsRd">Even including veterans Fredy Montero (35), Xavier Arreaga (28) and Stefan Cleveland (28), the average age of the Sounders’ starters was just 23.0. That was more than four years’ younger than San Diego’s lineup, whose average age was 27.3.</p>\n<p id="o08H1Y">Under normal circumstances, a 5-4 win at home over a lower-division opponent might seem little cause for celebration. But given the lineup the Sounders fielded — and the way the victory actually unfolded — the feelings around the result have been overwhelmingly positive within the organization.</p>\n<p id="akBlmI">“They had to overcome a couple of gut punches and that’s hard,” Schmetzer said the day after the game. “A lot of teams might fold. Credit to them.”</p>\n<p id="W2pCyZ">While Schmetzer surely would have preferred a less stressful result — the Sounders failed to hold leads of 2-0, 3-1 and 4-3 — he had to admit that there was some invaluable experience gained during the 120-minute affair.</p>\n<p id="qYpAqO">“The intensity, the pressure, playing against a good opponent,” Schmetzer said. “You can’t measure that kind of experience.”</p>\n<p id="U9ysLQ">Perhaps best exemplifying the Sounders’ performance was Cody Baker, a 19-year-old who got the starting nod at left back after signing a short-term contract. The Issaquah native first signed with the Tacoma Defiance in 2021 and has now accrued about 2,500 minutes in his professional career, but just two of his 25 career starts had come as a left back.</p>\n<p id="3kr1oE">Baker’s 2023 was actually off to a bit of a slow start, as injuries had limited him to just two appearances and one start. The start actually came on Sunday against <a href="https://www.dynamotheory.com">Houston Dynamo</a> 2, and he’d only been able to train with the first team on Tuesday.</p>\n<p id="FwuDvB">Still, Schmetzer had faith in him to execute the game plan, which he said consisted of relatively simple instructions: “lock it down.”</p>\n<p id="RLTOc3">“He’s a hard-nosed, no-nonsense defender,” Schmetzer said. “He’s got the mentality that I like.”</p>\n<p id="Y2eWda">Baker actually did more than that. In addition to 10 clearances, 8 recoveries, winning 7 of 10 duels and generally never looking out of place against veteran attackers, Baker also set up the Sounders’ third goal with an impressive left-footed pass that traveled about 50 yards and hit Paul Rothrock perfectly in stride. </p>\n<div id="CO3bCo">\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">First goal with the First Team ✅<br><br>Take a bow, Paul Rothrock! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SEAvSD?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SEAvSD</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Sounders?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Sounders</a> <a href="https://t.co/enVg1GTr73">pic.twitter.com/enVg1GTr73</a></p>— Seattle Sounders FC (@SoundersFC) <a href="https://twitter.com/SoundersFC/status/1651430231465676800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2023</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>\n</div>\n<p id="TqNNmv">Rothrock was one of three Sounders who scored their first career first-team goals in the match, joining Ethan Dobbelaere and Reed Baker-Whiting. Defiance players Rothrock, Travian Sousa and Hal Uderitz also made their first-team debuts, while Sota Kitahara got his first start for the Sounders. Of the 15 Sounders who featured in the match, 10 of them came to the organization through either the academy or Defiance.</p>\n<p id="Tuz2Mv">It wasn’t anything like a clinical performance, but in its own way it may have been even more important from the perspective of stress test for the health of the organization’s talent pipeline. Mature clubs should be able to dig into the reserves and still beat a lower-division opponent, even one that’s as good and experienced as San Diego.</p>\n<p id="h5JYDV">“It was really important for their confidence,” a clearly exhausted Montero said after the game. “They are training next to us every day and they deserve to have this opportunity in front of these people and they are getting used to the pressure. There was a lot of pressure they had to manage and they did well. And in the end, we won.”</p>	\N	2023-04-28 14:36:44-07	2023-04-28 14:36:44-07	7f9f29af28cb71e4
